         * TestCase and TestCaseGroup function as condition handlers on their own. The purpose is to keep a record of assert results.
         * The results must then be processed and sent to a Logger to view the results. This does not happen automatically.
         * 
         * TestCaseGroup is a composite class that can contain other TestCase objects. If you do not need such functionality, inheriting from
         * TestCase is recommended, it gives you easier access to test results, which would be stored in the child objects in the case of a group.
         * 
         * For best results, compile a report through CreateReport(), report logic has override support.
         * TestCaseGroup is coded to report its own results, and the results of its children. 
         * Reports needs to be handled by a logger to be viewed.
         * 
         * An alternative to using reports is to use an AssertHandler, such as DeferredAssertHandler to collect the assert results. The main
         * advantage of this approach is that it permits results to be processed one at a time allowing the user to curate the result output
         * before it is logged.
         * 
         * Shared state handling: Each test case is responsible for tracking, and handling its own results. An AssertHandler can be provided by overriding
         * TestCase.Handle, but this approach is not supported for test case groups by default. For TestCaseGroup, the user should take advantage of
         * TestCase.GroupState, a special object designed for passing behavior from a group to its children.
         * All children of a TestCaseGroup share a single SharedState passed down from its group instance, while test cases not part of a group have 
         * a separate state instance of their own.
         * ShareState is also how the utility a handler to be passed down from the TestSuite if the user chooses to define a global handler for their
         * test suite. This behavior can be opted out by setting the applicable flag through TestCase.GroupState.
         * In addition to the test suite handler, you can specify a handler specific to a TestCase, or TestCaseGroup through its SharedState instance.
         * In most cases, this is not necessary. This is only if you need the extra functionality, and customization.
         * 
         * Test case results can be handled by multiple handlers, but by default, your test results wont handle themselves. Choose the method of
         * handling results that matches your preferences.
         * 
         * This framework also allows full customization on the result message through the MessageFormatter class. 
         * MessageFormatter is customizable, and can be replaced with a custom one if necessary.
         * The default assertion responses may be found in UtilityConsts, and can be accessed and changed through public fields belonging to a
         * MessageFormatter instance.
         * 
         * Tag System: Tags are strings that can be attached to a result message, which is stored in the Message field of a Condition.Result object.
         * Tags will appear at the end of a result message. Tags allow for easier customization of the result format, while also providing useful
         * information about the result not provided by the message.
         * It is safe to modify the Tags collection, which are stored in Message.Tags.
